  abstract={Band division multiplexing (BDM) is a promising technology to upgrade the capacity of elastic optical networks (EON). By using both C and L bands instead of just the C-band, networks can support a larger number of connections. This paper presents and analyzes a set of novel strategies to ensure resiliency in multiband optical networks leveraging the unique characteristics of these networks and their amplifiers. We investigate two new protection methods for these networks, erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) protection and hybrid protection, and compare them with two established protection techniques, dedicated path protection (DPP) and shared backup path protection (SBPP). Recognizing that protection requirements vary among services, we also propose a service level agreement (SLA) differentiated protection mechanism that combines these strategies. High-priority clients receive robust protection against single failures of fibers or EDFAs through DPP or SBPP, while low-priority clients are safeguarded at least against EDFA failures via EDFA or hybrid protection. Our studies explore the most effective combinations of these techniques across various scenarios, demonstrating the advantages of SLA-differentiated protection over the utilization of a single classical protection method for all clients. Furthermore, we propose and analyze a more flexible protection mechanism that allows clients to divide their traffic into two segments: one requiring a high level of protection and the other a lower level. This flexibility enhances the protection options available, enabling a finer categorization of user needs and making it an attractive choice for network operators.}

  abstract={ETSI has considered a new set of services for the Release 2, which cannot be implemented using the single control channel. Therefore, it is necessary to regulate the operation of applications on multiple channels, what is called Multi-Channel Operation (MCO). In this case the interference from the first adjacent channel is not negligible and is recommended to manage it by congestion control mechanisms. We propose an elastic channel usage scheme for MCO, based on an optimal scheduler whose goal is to maximize the traffic on the channels while minimizing the adjacent channel interference generated by that load and controlling the congestion. We formulate the interference and congestion control as a constrained convex optimization problem and derive as solution a distributed algorithm called MINOS (MultI-chaNnel operation Optimal Scheduler). MINOS seamlessly work when vehicles have a different number of network interfaces available, and constraints and priorities can be set individually and dynamically, which provides flexibility to implement more sophisticated services on top of the framework. Our results show that MINOS effectively controls the congestion and reduces the interference, achieving an increased packet reception ratio across all channels and a higher allocated traffic, compared to other proposals.}

  ABSTRACT = {People with type 1 diabetes (T1D) need to monitor their blood glucose level frequently and use insulin to regulate it. T1D typically develops in young individuals and requires lifelong insulin injections for glycemic control. High or low blood glucose levels can lead to serious health issues. To address the challenges posed by regular monitoring and manual insulin injections, automated glucose control methods have been developed. Various insulin regimes are used to manage blood sugar levels, such as traditional regimes that involve one or two injections per day or multiple daily injection therapy, which offers more flexibility in the diet and dosage but still requires patients to monitor their carbohydrate intake and insulin injections. A proportional integral derivative (PID) controller is an automated glucose control method that is commonly used in commercial and research settings due to its simplicity and robustness. However, despite its effectiveness, this method can be affected by external factors like food, exercise, and illness. This study proposes to set an individualized observation frequency (OF) per user for the PID controller for blood glucose control in T1D. Optimizing the OF improves the PID controller’s performance, maintaining or elevating median glucose levels. Tuning the OF offers a simple and effective enhancement for the widely used PID controller.},

  abstract = {Point-to-multipoint (P2MP) coherent pluggable transceivers based on digital subcarrier multiplexing (DSCM) have been proposed as a promising technology to reduce the costs of optical transport networks. However, to establish the P2MP trees, bidirectional multicast functionality is required at the optical nodes. While conventional broadcast-and-select (B\&S) wavelength selective switch (WSS)-based reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexer (ROADM) architectures can inherently perform splitting operations, merge operations of DSCM signals face internal blocking in conventional WSSs since they require switching signals from different input ports on the same carrier wavelength (although using different subcarriers) to the common output port. In this paper, we propose an alternative ROADM architecture requiring a simple low-cost modification, which can support P2MP trees, provided that they are routed as linear chains with the hub node at one end, without requiring multicast-enabled WSSs. We evaluate the potential savings of linear hub-ended P2MP trees on a metro reference scenario using a modified tree-determination, routing, and spectrum assignment (TRSA) dimensioning algorithm. Results indicate that linear hub-ended trees can significantly reduce transceiver costs with respect to point-to-point (P2P) solutions in all considered cases, with savings ranging from 6\%--28\% depending on the traffic load. While these savings are somewhat less than those achievable with arbitrary P2MP trees and latency is slightly higher, spectrum waste is reduced by employing linear routing, and the trees can be supported by the proposed architecture.}

  abstract = {Pollution in urban areas is turning into a primary focus for local governments in developed nations around the globe. Lots of data are currently collected for this from smart developments provided with atmospheric and climatic sensors. A hot research line is now exploiting such data to extract patterns and predict pollution levels in such a way that countermeasures can be taken beforehand and exposure to harmful concentrations is avoided. However, a key issue is the lack of significant data, due to incomplete smart infrastructures or calibration problems in sensors. Dealing with this, in this paper we propose the exploitation of synthetic data generation to enhance pollution prediction based on limited data sources, concretely extending real measurements of two weeks to up to ten extra years. We present a data generation approach based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), with a particular model focused on generating artificial pollution data, which is later exploited using different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Results indicate that the usage of synthetic data further improves prediction when used as the basis dataset to be later finetuned using real records. For 62% of pollutants this way to proceed in data mixing (among five different approaches) provides the best results in evaluations. Such effect is due to extra model robustness due to data regularization, and better generalization capabilities by avoiding sensor limitations in real deployments.}

  abstract = {Urban environments around the world are being highly populated by personal mobility vehicles, such as scooters or electric bicycles, which offer a new way to move around cities. Researchers from different disciplines are devoting efforts to integrate this novel vehicular paradigm into smart-city ecosystems given its advantages in terms of traffic sustainability, efficiency, and agility. However, the quick penetration of these vehicles also brings challenges and concerns related to their coexistence with other kinds of transportation systems or pedestrians, as well as the high number of accidents in which these vehicles are involved. When an accident happens, a fast and automatic detection is crucial to take quick measures, e.g., alerting emergency services. This is the main motivation of the dataset presented in this work, which provides the data captured by different sensors onboard an electric scooter under regular and accident conditions. A variety of accident kinds such as frontal collisions, lateral falls, etc. are considered, so the dataset may be valuable for the development of automatic engines to infer different riding situations.}

  abstract={The recently proposed band division multiplexing (BDM) technology enables network operators to leverage existing optical fibers more effectively. By expanding from the conventional C-band to the L-band, and potentially to the S and E bands, network capacity improves at least two times. This rate of capacity improvement allows the support of significantly more connections compared to the current elastic optical networks (EONs). However, the increased capacity also means that a network failure might cause huge data loss, making the employment of survivability methods a must. On the other hand, since the required level of protection might vary across different users, the implementation of an effective service level agreement (SLA) mechanism is crucial for enhancing network performance and optimizing costs. Since transceivers are among the most expensive components, in this paper, we aim to modify an SLA-differentiated protection for C+L band networks that we previously proposed, focusing on reducing transceiver usage. The modified SLA-differentiated method is evaluated against the original one in terms of network performance and transceiver consumption. We demonstrate that the introduced variation of the SLA mechanism achieves a significant reduction in the number of utilized transceivers.},

  abstract={Extreme-edge computing is an emerging paradigm that utilizes the computational capabilities of end devices to perform localized data processing, thus enabling responsive and adaptive operations in industrial settings. This article addresses the challenge of dynamic scheduling and workload distribution in multiautomated guided vehicle (AGV) systems, where tasks include both movement (e.g., navigation, loading and unloading) and data processing (e.g., onboard computation). To capture realistic conditions, a dynamic service request model is adopted, in which each request consists of a set of movement and/or data processing operations. We first present a mathematical formulation to formally define the constraints associated with resource assignment and movement operations. Building on this, we propose a novel heuristic, queue-aware scheduling and deadlock mitigation strategy (QASDMS), for assigning operations to AGVs. QASDMS considers factors, such as AGV locations, resource availability, execution queues, and potential deadlocks, while supporting the arrival of dynamic unpredictable requests. The objective is to minimize the total time required to complete the operations described in the service requests. To evaluate system performance, the resource intensity index (RII) is introduced, which measures CPU and RAM usage relative to the number of completed operations. Simulation results in both medium and large-scale scenarios show that QASDMS improves the total number of completed operations by over 190% compared to a baseline case, while keeping CPU and RAM usage below 21% . Furthermore, QASDMS achieves significantly lower RII values (over 60% reduction), indicating more efficient resource utilization. These results highlight the potential of QASDMS to improve performance in multi-AGV extreme-edge environments.},

  abstract={Emerging applications such as extreme virtual reality, enterprise access, 5G front-haul / back-haul, and future 6G immersive services demand exceptional bandwidth and low latency. Next-generation passive optical networks (PONs), including 25G/50G-EPON (Ethernet PON) and 50G-PON, address these requirements. However, the telecoms sector faces sustainability challenges, with networks consuming over 75% of the sector’s energy and contributing more than 25% of greenhouse gas emissions, which is increasing with bandwidth demand. Fiber-based PON networks offer high-speed, low-latency, and energy-efficient solutions. To further enhance energy efficiency, we developed a dynamic bandwidth wavelength allocation (DBWA) algorithm for 50G-EPON systems, adapted for single- and dual-wavelength configurations. For single-wavelength ( $1\times 50$ G) configurations, the sleep mode aware algorithm (SMA) activates the optical network unit (ONU) sleep mode when no data are transmitted, reducing energy consumption and ensuring minimal delay due to the absence of wavelength switching. For dual-wavelength ( $2\times 25$ G) systems, the online restricted wavelength switching (RWS) algorithm dynamically allocates wavelengths upon receiving user reports, regulating the switching to minimize delays while achieving energy savings at the ONU. Finally, leveraging a predictive approach, the offline restricted wavelength usage and switching (RWUS) algorithm evaluates bandwidth demands over 0.1-second intervals, enabling energy-efficient wavelength switching and optimizing both optical line terminal (OLT) and ONU energy usage. The simulation results highlight the superior energy efficiency of the offline RWUS algorithm and the extended ONU sleep times, especially under low load conditions, while maintaining the lowest delay among multi-wavelength algorithms. Conversely, despite being less energy-efficient, the SMA algorithm scores slightly better in delay for single-wavelength systems. All algorithms ensure compliance with service level agreements (SLAs), providing reliable bandwidth allocation for various profiles. These results support green PON deployments and recommend the RWUS algorithm for two-wavelength 50G-EPON systems ( $2 \times 25$ G) and SMA for single-wavelength 50G-EPON ( $1 \times 50$ G) to optimize energy efficiency, latency, and quality of service.},

abstract = {A fundamental component of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) is connectivity. For connected vehicles to be aware of events occurring nearby, or even far from them, roadside infrastructure is essential. Roadside Units (RSUs) are electronic equipment placed along highways to provide connectivity and share data with vehicles, other RSUs, and networks. Connected vehicles require wireless communication with RSUs; however, depending on the complexity of tasks and the number of users, spectrum resources may be insufficient to handle all required communication between vehicles, RSUs and external networks. Since RSUs are stationary, optical fiber is an ideal technology for interconnecting them and linking them to the Internet and the cloud, providing reliable, high-performance connectivity, with low signal attenuation and high bandwidth. This paper proposes a model for deploying fiber networks to connect RSUs, with a focus on minimizing capital expenditures, including costs for civil works, cables, and devices, which are critical considerations given the large distances involved. Specifically, we consider and compare two established optical network technologies: point-to-point (PtP) and passive optical networks (PON). To support this comparison, we present and test two novel Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulations: one for PtP and one for PON. Additionally, we introduce a genetic algorithm that improves upon a previously proposed heuristic, achieving near-optimal results comparable to the ILP formulation, while efficiently solving large-scale scenarios. The results show that the optimal choice between PtP and PON depends on the deployment area and density of RSUs.}

European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) Release 2 services cannot be deployed using a single control channel, and require the management of multiple channels used simultaneously by applications. Because of this, ETSI defined a mechanism called Multi-Channel Operation (MCO). Two simple MCO load allocation mechanisms have been recommended, load balancing and sequential filling, but they have not been evaluated in detail until now. In this paper, these two mechanisms, as well as their congestion control variants, are evaluated. An open-source simulation framework has been implemented for such a work, which is open to future extensions. Then, through multiple evaluations following the ETSI simulation setup, we discuss the behavior of these mechanisms under scenarios with a highly congested medium, employing different traffic loads and vehicular densities. Our results show that MCO improvement is limited under high-load conditions, by saturation of channels before switching to a new one (sequential filling) and synchronization of channel assignment among vehicles (load balancing), and the introduction of a simple reactive congestion control does not improve their performance. The main limitations are examined, and recommendations are provided to guide the evolution of these mechanisms.}

ABSTRACT = {Industry 4.0 (I4.0) is reshaping manufacturing by integrating advanced digital technologies and is increasingly seen as an enabler of the circular economy (CE). However, most research treats digitalisation and circularity separately, with limited empirical insight regarding their combined implementation. This study investigates I4.0 adoption to support sustainability and CE across industries, focusing on how enterprise size influences adoption patterns. Based on survey data from 69 enterprises, the research examines which technologies are applied, at what stages of the product life cycle, and what barriers and drivers influence uptake. Findings reveal a modest but growing adoption led by the Internet of Things (IoT), big data, and integrated systems. While larger firms implement more advanced tools (e.g., robotics and simulation), smaller enterprises favour accessible solutions (e.g., IoT and cloud computing). A positive link is observed between digital adoption and CE practices, though barriers remain significant. Five main categories of perceived obstacles are identified: political/institutional, financial, social/market-related, technological/infrastructural, and legal/regulatory. Attitudinal resistance, particularly in micro and small enterprises, emerges as an additional challenge. Based on these insights, and to support the twin transition, the paper proposes targeted policies, including expanded funding, streamlined procedures, enhanced training, and tools for circular performance monitoring.},
