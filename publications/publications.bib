  abstract={Band division multiplexing (BDM) is a promising technology to upgrade the capacity of elastic optical networks (EON). By using both C and L bands instead of just the C-band, networks can support a larger number of connections. This paper presents and analyzes a set of novel strategies to ensure resiliency in multiband optical networks leveraging the unique characteristics of these networks and their amplifiers. We investigate two new protection methods for these networks, erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) protection and hybrid protection, and compare them with two established protection techniques, dedicated path protection (DPP) and shared backup path protection (SBPP). Recognizing that protection requirements vary among services, we also propose a service level agreement (SLA) differentiated protection mechanism that combines these strategies. High-priority clients receive robust protection against single failures of fibers or EDFAs through DPP or SBPP, while low-priority clients are safeguarded at least against EDFA failures via EDFA or hybrid protection. Our studies explore the most effective combinations of these techniques across various scenarios, demonstrating the advantages of SLA-differentiated protection over the utilization of a single classical protection method for all clients. Furthermore, we propose and analyze a more flexible protection mechanism that allows clients to divide their traffic into two segments: one requiring a high level of protection and the other a lower level. This flexibility enhances the protection options available, enabling a finer categorization of user needs and making it an attractive choice for network operators.}

  abstract={ETSI has considered a new set of services for the Release 2, which cannot be implemented using the single control channel. Therefore, it is necessary to regulate the operation of applications on multiple channels, what is called Multi-Channel Operation (MCO). In this case the interference from the first adjacent channel is not negligible and is recommended to manage it by congestion control mechanisms. We propose an elastic channel usage scheme for MCO, based on an optimal scheduler whose goal is to maximize the traffic on the channels while minimizing the adjacent channel interference generated by that load and controlling the congestion. We formulate the interference and congestion control as a constrained convex optimization problem and derive as solution a distributed algorithm called MINOS (MultI-chaNnel operation Optimal Scheduler). MINOS seamlessly work when vehicles have a different number of network interfaces available, and constraints and priorities can be set individually and dynamically, which provides flexibility to implement more sophisticated services on top of the framework. Our results show that MINOS effectively controls the congestion and reduces the interference, achieving an increased packet reception ratio across all channels and a higher allocated traffic, compared to other proposals.}

  ABSTRACT = {People with type 1 diabetes (T1D) need to monitor their blood glucose level frequently and use insulin to regulate it. T1D typically develops in young individuals and requires lifelong insulin injections for glycemic control. High or low blood glucose levels can lead to serious health issues. To address the challenges posed by regular monitoring and manual insulin injections, automated glucose control methods have been developed. Various insulin regimes are used to manage blood sugar levels, such as traditional regimes that involve one or two injections per day or multiple daily injection therapy, which offers more flexibility in the diet and dosage but still requires patients to monitor their carbohydrate intake and insulin injections. A proportional integral derivative (PID) controller is an automated glucose control method that is commonly used in commercial and research settings due to its simplicity and robustness. However, despite its effectiveness, this method can be affected by external factors like food, exercise, and illness. This study proposes to set an individualized observation frequency (OF) per user for the PID controller for blood glucose control in T1D. Optimizing the OF improves the PID controller’s performance, maintaining or elevating median glucose levels. Tuning the OF offers a simple and effective enhancement for the widely used PID controller.},

  abstract = {Point-to-multipoint (P2MP) coherent pluggable transceivers based on digital subcarrier multiplexing (DSCM) have been proposed as a promising technology to reduce the costs of optical transport networks. However, to establish the P2MP trees, bidirectional multicast functionality is required at the optical nodes. While conventional broadcast-and-select (B\&S) wavelength selective switch (WSS)-based reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexer (ROADM) architectures can inherently perform splitting operations, merge operations of DSCM signals face internal blocking in conventional WSSs since they require switching signals from different input ports on the same carrier wavelength (although using different subcarriers) to the common output port. In this paper, we propose an alternative ROADM architecture requiring a simple low-cost modification, which can support P2MP trees, provided that they are routed as linear chains with the hub node at one end, without requiring multicast-enabled WSSs. We evaluate the potential savings of linear hub-ended P2MP trees on a metro reference scenario using a modified tree-determination, routing, and spectrum assignment (TRSA) dimensioning algorithm. Results indicate that linear hub-ended trees can significantly reduce transceiver costs with respect to point-to-point (P2P) solutions in all considered cases, with savings ranging from 6\%--28\% depending on the traffic load. While these savings are somewhat less than those achievable with arbitrary P2MP trees and latency is slightly higher, spectrum waste is reduced by employing linear routing, and the trees can be supported by the proposed architecture.}

  abstract = {Pollution in urban areas is turning into a primary focus for local governments in developed nations around the globe. Lots of data are currently collected for this from smart developments provided with atmospheric and climatic sensors. A hot research line is now exploiting such data to extract patterns and predict pollution levels in such a way that countermeasures can be taken beforehand and exposure to harmful concentrations is avoided. However, a key issue is the lack of significant data, due to incomplete smart infrastructures or calibration problems in sensors. Dealing with this, in this paper we propose the exploitation of synthetic data generation to enhance pollution prediction based on limited data sources, concretely extending real measurements of two weeks to up to ten extra years. We present a data generation approach based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), with a particular model focused on generating artificial pollution data, which is later exploited using different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Results indicate that the usage of synthetic data further improves prediction when used as the basis dataset to be later finetuned using real records. For 62% of pollutants this way to proceed in data mixing (among five different approaches) provides the best results in evaluations. Such effect is due to extra model robustness due to data regularization, and better generalization capabilities by avoiding sensor limitations in real deployments.}

  abstract = {Urban environments around the world are being highly populated by personal mobility vehicles, such as scooters or electric bicycles, which offer a new way to move around cities. Researchers from different disciplines are devoting efforts to integrate this novel vehicular paradigm into smart-city ecosystems given its advantages in terms of traffic sustainability, efficiency, and agility. However, the quick penetration of these vehicles also brings challenges and concerns related to their coexistence with other kinds of transportation systems or pedestrians, as well as the high number of accidents in which these vehicles are involved. When an accident happens, a fast and automatic detection is crucial to take quick measures, e.g., alerting emergency services. This is the main motivation of the dataset presented in this work, which provides the data captured by different sensors onboard an electric scooter under regular and accident conditions. A variety of accident kinds such as frontal collisions, lateral falls, etc. are considered, so the dataset may be valuable for the development of automatic engines to infer different riding situations.}
