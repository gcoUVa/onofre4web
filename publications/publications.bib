    abstract = {Diabetes mellitus is a disease associated with abnormally high levels of blood glucose due to a lack of insulin. Combining an insulin pump and continuous glucose monitor with a control algorithm to deliver insulin is an alternative to patient self-management of insulin doses to control blood glucose levels in diabetes mellitus patients. In this work, we propose a closed-loop control for blood glucose levels based on deep reinforcement learning. We describe the initial evaluation of several alternatives conducted on a realistic simulator of the glucoregulatory system and propose a particular implementation strategy based on reducing the frequency of the observations and rewards passed to the agent, and using a simple reward function. We train agents with that strategy for three groups of patient classes, evaluate and compare it with alternative control baselines. Our results show that our method is able to outperform baselines as well as similar recent proposals, by achieving longer periods of safe glycemic state and low risk.},

abstract = {The significant increase in large-scale wildfire events in recent decades, caused primarily by climate change, has resulted in a growing number of aerial resources being used in suppression efforts. Present-day management lacks efficient and scalable algorithms for complex aerial resource allocation and scheduling for the extinction of such fires, which is crucial to ensuring safety while maximizing the efficiency of operations. In this work, we present a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) optimization model tailored to large-scale wildfires for the daily scheduling of aerial operations. The main objective is to achieve a prioritized target water flow over all areas of operation and all time periods. Minimal target completion across individual areas and time periods and total water output are also maximized as secondary and ternary objectives, respectively. An efficient and scalable multi-start heuristic, combining a randomized greedy approach with simulated annealing employing large neighborhood search techniques, is proposed for larger instances. A diverse set of problem instances is generated with varying sizes and extinction strategies to test the approaches. Results indicate that the heuristic can achieve (near)-optimal solutions for smaller instances solvable by the MILP, and gives solutions approaching target water flows for larger problem sizes. The algorithm is parallelizable and has been shown to give promising results in a small number of iterations, making it applicable for both night-before planning and, more time-sensitive, early-morning scheduling.}

abstract = {The application of data-driven methods is expected to play an increasingly important role in healthcare. However, a lack of personnel with the necessary skills to develop these models and interpret its output is preventing a wider adoption of these methods. To address this gap, we introduce and describe ORIENTATE, a software for automated application of machine learning classification algorithms by clinical practitioners lacking specific technical skills. ORIENTATE allows the selection of features and the target variable, then automatically generates a number of classification models and cross-validates them, finding the best model and evaluating it. It also implements a custom feature selection algorithm for systematic searches of the best combination of predictors for a given target variable. Finally, it outputs a comprehensive report with graphs that facilitates the explanation of the classification model results, using global interpretation methods, and an interface for the prediction of new input samples. Feature relevance and interaction plots provided by ORIENTATE allow to use it for statistical inference, which can replace and/or complement classical statistical studies.}

Given a physical optical fiber network with P2MP transceivers and a target IP topology with associated capacity requirements, the TRSA problem involves partitioning capacity demands into logical hub--spoke trees and associated transceiver allocation, along with light-tree routing and spectrum assignment. We propose a heuristic algorithm to solve the TRSA problem with and without fault tolerance for arbitrary network topologies. The algorithms are used to evaluate potential cost benefits of P2MP transceivers for different IP densities and loads in a case study on a metro-network reference scenario. Results indicate that P2MP equipment can bring significant transceiver cost and equipment savings in comparison to point-to-point solutions, although such savings come at a trade-off with increased spectrum occupation.},

    abstract = {Time series sensor data classification tasks often suffer from training data scarcity issue due to the expenses associated with the expert-intervened annotation efforts. For example, Electrocardiogram (ECG) data classification for cardio-vascular disease (CVD) detection requires expensive labeling procedures with the help of cardiologists. Current state-of-the-art algorithms like deep learning models have shown outstanding performance under the general requirement of availability of large set of training examples. In this paper, we propose Shapley Attributed Ablation with Augmented Learning: ShapAAL, which demonstrates that deep learning algorithm with suitably selected subset of the seen examples or ablating the unimportant ones from the given limited training dataset can ensure consistently better classification performance under augmented training. In ShapAAL, additive perturbed training augments the input space to compensate the scarcity in training examples using Residual Network (ResNet) architecture through perturbation-induced inputs, while Shapley attribution seeks the subset from the augmented training space for better learnability with the goal of better general predictive performance, thanks to the “efficiency” and “null player” axioms of transferable utility games upon which Shapley value game is formulated. In ShapAAL, the subset of training examples that contribute positively to a supervised learning setup is derived from the notion of coalition games using Shapley values associated with each of the given inputs’ contribution into the model prediction. ShapAAL is a novel push-pull deep architecture where the subset selection through Shapley value attribution pushes the model to lower dimension while augmented training augments the learning capability of the model over unseen data. We perform ablation study to provide the empirical evidence of our claim and we show that proposed ShapAAL method consistently outperforms the current baselines and state-of-the-art algorithms for time series sensor data classification tasks from publicly available UCR time series archive that includes different practical important problems like detection of CVDs from ECG data.},

ABSTRACT = {Climate change is increasing temperatures and causing periods of water scarcity in arid and semi-arid climates. The agricultural sector is one of the most affected by these changes, having to optimise scarce water resources. An important phenomenon within the water cycle is the evaporation from water reservoirs, which implies a considerable amount of water lost during warmer periods of the year. Indeed, evaporation rate forecasting can help farmers grow crops more sustainably by managing water resources more efficiently in the context of precision agriculture. In this work, we expose an interpretable machine learning approach, based on a multivariate decision tree, to forecast the evaporation rate on a daily basis using data from an Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure, which is deployed on a real irrigated plot located in Murcia (southeastern Spain). The climate data collected feed the models that provide a forecast of evaporation and a summary of the parameters involved in this process. Finally, the results of the interpretable presented model are validated with the best literature models for evaporation rate prediction, i.e., Artificial Neural Networks, obtaining results very similar to those obtained for them, reaching up to 0.85R2 and 0.6MAE. Therefore, in this work, a double objective is faced: to maintain the performance obtained by the models most frequently used in the problem while maintaining the interpretability of the knowledge captured in it, which allows better understanding the problem and carrying out appropriate actions.},

ABSTRACT = {Encouraged by the European Union, all European countries need to enforce solutions to reduce non-renewable energy consumption in buildings. The reduction of energy (heating, domestic hot water, and appliances consumption) aims for the vision of near-zero energy consumption as a requirement goal for constructing buildings. In this paper, we review the available standards, tools and frameworks on the energy performance of buildings. Additionally, this work investigates if energy performance ratings can be obtained with energy consumption data from IoT devices and if the floor size and energy consumption values are enough to determine a dwellings&rsquo; energy performance rating. The essential outcome of this work is a data-driven prediction tool for energy performance labels that can run automatically. The tool is based on the cutting edge kNN classification algorithm and trained on open datasets with actual building data such as those coming from the IoT paradigm. Additionally, it assesses the results of the prediction by analysing its accuracy values. Furthermore, an approach to semantic annotations for energy performance certification data with currently available ontologies is presented. Use cases for an extension of this work are also discussed in the end.},

ABSTRACT = {The temperature of indoor spaces is at the core of highly relevant topics such as comfort, productivity and health. In conditioned spaces, this temperature is determined by thermostat preferences, but there is a lack of understanding of this phenomenon as a time-dependent magnitude. In addition to this, there is scientific evidence that the mental models of how users understand the operation of the billions of air-conditioning machines around the world are incorrect, which causes systems to &lsquo;compensate&rsquo; for temperatures outside by adjusting the thermostat, which leads to erratic changes on set-points over the day. This paper presents the first model of set-point temperature as a time-dependent variable. Additionally, a new mathematical algorithm was developed to complement these models and make possible their identification on the go, called the life Bayesian inference of transition matrices. Data from a total of 75 + 35 real thermostats in two buildings for more than a year were used to validate the model. The method was shown to be highly accurate, fast, and computationally trivial in terms of time and memory, representing a change in the paradigm for smart thermostats.},

abstract = {The electric grid is undertaking a change of paradigm. New requirements such as the high power loads of Electric Vehicles’ charging are putting pressure on grids, and the popularisation of the figure of the prosumers, are creating new needs on the management of the system. Although the investment on infrastructure is one of the ways of alleviating the arrival of this new loads, the existence of smart controls, actuators and smart appliances opens also the door for demand modification. The so called Demand Response Events are strategies to reallocate the loads of the consumers, so the power demand is shifted towards times less critical for the grid. Some smart appliances can be considered as shiftable. The operation of them can be rescheduled to other times and still provide their services. On this paper we suggest an optimisation methodology consisting on a parallelisation method together with a generic algorithm that would allow an overlooking controller (such as aggregator or DSO) reduce the power peaks even with a large number of devices to control. The research here presented has looked for the smallest group size at which the optimisation is more effectible done in parallel groups rather than on a single large set. With this, we eliminated the exponential growth of the computational effort that the optimisation algorithm would need to do organising all devices in one go. The method achieves a computational time reduction of 80%, and it is only worsening the reduction of peak by 2.8% compared to an optimisation with a complete set.}

However, measurements are scarce, and accurate electromagnetic field reconstruction in a geographic region remains challenging. This work proposes a conditional generative adversarial network to address this issue. The main objective is to reconstruct the electromagnetic field exposure map accurately according to the environment&rsquo;s topology from a few sensors located in an outdoor urban environment. The model is trained to learn and estimate the propagation characteristics of the electromagnetic field according to the topology of a given environment. In addition, the conditional generative adversarial network-based electromagnetic field mapping is compared with simple kriging. Results show that the proposed method produces accurate estimates and is a promising solution for exposure map reconstruction.},

C-V2X can support efficient vehicle to vehicle and vehicle to infrastructure data transmission, and is said to be a key enabler of cooperative connected and automated mobility (CCAM). Performance of 5G New Radio (5G-NR) is expected to address bandwidth and delay requirements of services for autonomous vehicles. This is the theory and what particular research works have showed through simulation or limited prototypes. On the contrary, this work focuses on evaluating real 5G deployments (including 5G-NR) of network operators in CCAM scenarios, with particular emphasis on cross-border settings and service continuity under inter-operator handovers. The paper presents an evaluation platform to gather cross-layer measurements, homogenise results, perform comparative assessment of figures of merit, and calculate network and CCAM key performance indicators (KPIs). The platform is evaluated through implementing a use case for autonomous overtaking, involving two 5G-NR operator deployments at the Spanish-Portuguese border. Results reveal good network performances and correct operation of the service, thanks to 5G-NR and edge servers, although significant impact of handovers is detected on network and overtaking KPIs.}

abstract = {Future generations of mobile networks will require increased backhaul capacity to connect a massive amount of small cells (SCs) to the network. Since having an optical connection to each SC might be infeasible, mmWave links are an interesting alternative due to their large available bandwidth. An advantage of a wireless backhaul is that the topology can be reconfigured to adapt to changing traffic demands, new operator policies, or to rapidly overcome network failures. In this work, we investigate the problem of orchestrating the reconfiguration of mmWave wireless backhaul networks with mechanically steerable antennas assuming green backhaul operation where nodes are turned off when not in use. The orchestration involves scheduling and coordinating the powering on/off of nodes, the rotation of antennas to achieve alignment for link establishment, and setting up and tearing down links to minimize packet loss during the reconfiguration. We model the problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) for optimal orchestration and propose a sub-optimal reduced MILP for larger instances. Numerical results for different topologies using a realistic traffic trace indicate that optimizing reconfiguration orchestration can significantly reduce packet loss in comparison to a straightforward reconfiguration approach, enabling a smooth transition between target mmWave backhaul topologies.}

abstract = {Point-to-multipoint (P2MP) coherent optics using digital subcarrier multiplexing have recently been proposed as a promising new technology to reduce the cost and complexity of optical transport networks, particularly those in metro aggregation scenarios with hub-and-spoke (H\&S) traffic patterns. In this paper, we perform a case study on fault tolerant ring networks with more general traffic profiles to assess the benefits of P2MP optics for alternative network scenarios such as those appearing in metro rings. We propose mixed integer linear programming formulations for multilayer capacity planning to minimize total transceiver costs, considering both point-to-point and P2MP transceivers, as well as a heuristic approach for the more complex P2MP case. Results indicate that P2MP optics can bring several advantages for all tested traffic profiles, ranging from pure uniform flows to mostly H\&S. Transceiver cost savings are achieved in various cases, greater at higher network loads and for traffic patterns that are mostly H\&S. Results also show that P2MP optics prompt a multilayer redesign of the network with significantly reduced spectrum usage and a reduced number of IP hops, resulting in lower optical--electronic--optical and IP processing latency and lower IP layer equipment costs for all traffic profiles.},

abstract = {In vehicular communications, the increase of the channel load caused by excessive periodical messages (beacons) is an important aspect which must be controlled to ensure the appropriate operation of safety applications and driver-assistance systems. To date, the majority of congestion control solutions involve including additional information in the payload of the messages transmitted, which may jeopardize the appropriate operation of these control solutions when channel conditions are unfavorable, provoking packet losses. This study exploits the advantages of non-cooperative, distributed beaconing allocation, in which vehicles operate independently without requiring any costly road infrastructure. In particular, we formulate the beaconing rate control problem as a Markov Decision Process and solve it using approximate reinforcement learning to carry out optimal actions. Results obtained were compared with other traditional solutions, revealing that our approach, called SSFA, is able to keep a certain fraction of the channel capacity available, which guarantees the delivery of emergency-related notifications with faster convergence than other proposals. Moreover, good performance was obtained in terms of packet delivery and collision ratios.},

abstract = {The exponential growth of mobile applications and services during the last years has challenged the existing network infrastructures. Consequently, the arrival of multiple management solutions to cope with this explosion along the end-to-end network chain has increased the complexity in the coordinated orchestration of different segments composing the whole infrastructure. The Zero-touch Network and Service Management (ZSM) concept has recently emerged to automatically orchestrate and manage network resources while assuring the Quality of Experience (QoE) demanded by users. Machine Learning (ML) is one of the key enabling technologies that many ZSM frameworks are adopting to bring intelligent decision making to the network management system. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art application of ML-based techniques to improve ZSM performance. To this end, the main related standardization activities and the aligned international projects and research efforts are deeply examined. From this dissection, the skyrocketing growth of the ZSM paradigm can be observed. Concretely, different standardization bodies have already designed reference architectures to set the foundations of novel automatic network management functions and resource orchestration. Aligned with these advances, diverse ML techniques are being currently exploited to build further ZSM developments in different aspects, including multi-tenancy management, traffic monitoring, and architecture coordination, among others. However, different challenges, such as the complexity, scalability, and security of ML mechanisms, are also identified, and future research guidelines are provided to accomplish a firm development of the ZSM ecosystem.}

abstract = {The expansion of the Internet of Moving Things (IoMT) leads to limitless and continuous working playgrounds exploited by highly dynamic end devices. This requires the adoption of multi-Radio Access Technologies (RATs)-based strategies to provide IoMT units with ubiquitous connectivity. To this end, the development of secure bootstrapping and authentication mechanisms is necessary to permit the secure operation of end devices. Given the transmission and power limitations of these elements, current cryptographic solutions do not address these stringent requirements. For that reason, in the study we present a Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC)-based end-to-end architecture that enables an efficient and secure authentication and key agreement between end devices and network servers over heterogeneous resource-limited networks such as the Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs). Our proposal is based on the Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) architecture and the recent Internet Engineering Task Force initiatives Static Context Header Compression and Low-Overhead CoAP-EAP. The results obtained from experimental tests reveal the validity of the proposal as it enables constrained IoMT devices to gain IPv6 connectivity as well as performs end-to-end secure authentication with notable reliability and controlled latency.}

abstract = {Abstract Deep learning (DL) techniques have been extensively studied to improve their precision and scalability in a vast range of applications. Recently, a new milestone has been reached driven by the emergence of the TinyDL paradigm, which enables adaptation of complex DL models generated by well-known libraries to the restrictions of constrained microcontroller-based devices. In this work, a comprehensive discussion is provided regarding this novel ecosystem, by identifying the benefits that it will bring to the wearable industry and analysing different TinyDL initiatives promoted by tech giants. The specific use case of automatic user recognition from data captured by a wearable device is also presented. The whole development process by which different DL configurations have been embedded in a real microcontroller unit is described. The attained results in terms of accuracy and resource usage confirm the validity of the proposal, which allows precise predictions in a highly constrained platform with limited input information. Therefore, this work provides insights into the viability of the integration of TinyDL models within wearables, which may be valuable for researchers, practitioners, and makers related to this industry.},

ABSTRACT = {A new wave of electric vehicles for personal mobility is currently crowding public spaces. They offer a sustainable and efficient way of getting around in urban environments, however, these devices bring additional safety issues, including serious accidents for riders. Thereby, taking advantage of a connected personal mobility vehicle, we present a novel on-device Machine Learning (ML)-based fall detection system that analyzes data captured from a range of sensors integrated on an on-board unit (OBU) prototype. Given the typical processing limitations of these elements, we exploit the potential of the TinyML paradigm, which enables embedding powerful ML algorithms in constrained units. We have generated and publicly released a large dataset, including real riding measurements and realistically simulated falling events, which has been employed to produce different TinyML models. The attained results show the good operation of the system to detect falls efficiently using embedded OBUs. The considered algorithms have been successfully tested on mass-market low-power units, implying reduced energy consumption, flash footprints and running times, enabling new possibilities for this kind of vehicles.},

    abstract = {Accurate characterization and simulation of electromagnetic propagation can be obtained by ray-tracing methods, which are based on a high frequency approximation to the Maxwell equations and describe the propagating field as a set of propagating rays, reflecting, diffracting and scattering over environment elements. However, this approach has been usually too computationally costly to be used in large and dynamic scenarios, but this situation is changing thanks the increasing availability of efficient ray-tracing libraries for graphical processing units. In this paper we present Opal, an electromagnetic propagation simulation tool implemented with ray-tracing on graphical processing units, which is part of the Veneris framework. Opal can be used as a stand-alone ray-tracing simulator, but its main strength lies in its integration with the game engine, which allows to generate customized 3D environments quickly and intuitively. We describe its most relevant features and provide implementation details, highlighting the different simulation types it supports and its extension possibilites. We provide application examples and validate the simulation on demanding scenarios, such as tunnels, where we compare the results with theoretical solutions and further discuss the tradeoffs between the simulation types and its performance.},

abstract = {Telecom operators' infrastructure is sustained by optical communication networks that provide the means for exchanging large amounts of information, which is essential for many modern society needs. Optical networks are characterized by rapid breakthroughs in a variety of technologies. Relevantly, the last decade encompassed remarkable advances in optical networks’ subfields of signal processing, electronics, photonics, communications, protocols, and control-plane architectures. Hence, these advancements unlocked unprecedented transmission capacities, reconfigurability and programmability, entailing an evolution in the way which networks were designed, planned, and analyzed. In this paper, we review the historical status of optical planning and design tools by focusing on the major enabling technologies and relevant landmarks of the last decade(s). We begin by pinpointing the major breakthroughs in the optical data plane, estimation models capturing the transmission medium behavior and the control plane. We then distil the implications that these advancements entail in the landscape of optical network design and analysis tools, which commonly sit “on top” of the control plane or as a fully separated entity. Then, we speculate with our view for the future, in which automatic validation of optical network operations and dimensioning jointly with learning/artificial intelligence mechanisms will permit zero-touch optical networking: i.e. updating, provisioning, and upgrading network capacities, by means of automation with minimal human intervention. We conclude with a proposal of an architecture that encompasses data and control planes in a comprehensive manner for paving the way towards zero-touch optical networking.}
