ONOFRE-4 aims to develop efficient planning and management mechanisms for network infrastructures equipped with computing
resources. The focus is on providing support for connected, reliable and secure mobility, with special consideration given to the
interrelation between networks operated by different actors.<p>
In concrete terms, the project starts from the assumption that to fully exploit the potential of connected mobility in general, it is essential to
have robust and reliable communication infrastructures, both wired and wireless, equipped with computing resources, and supported by
effective orchestration procedures. It also highlights the importance of considering multi-operator and even multi-stakeholder scenarios. As
vehicles move across different geographical regions, networks managed by different operators and their associated computing resources
should facilitate seamless connectivity and uninterrupted access to subscribed services, thus contributing to a more connected and
cohesive mobility ecosystem. In addition, communication and computing infrastructures of different operators, and even of other actors
such as public administrations, companies or industries, may exist in the same geographical area. Therefore, the interrelation of these
infrastructures, enabling a shared use of resources under certain conditions, and articulated through smart contracts, will enhance
efficiency in service provision and create new opportunities for operators and other stakeholders.<p>
ONOFRE-4 will advance on (1) providing efficient planning and management mechanisms for wired and wireless network infrastructures
equipped with computing resources, (2) optimizing the use of multiband technologies and coherent pluggable transceivers in optical
networks, along with a focus on emerging standards on access networks, (3) optimizing the co-existence of multiple radio access
technologies with special emphasis on recently introduced techniques such as multi-channel operation (MCO), (4) optimizing the services
offered by the network and its computing infrastructure, exploiting orchestration, federated learning and computation offloading in multistakeholder
environments, (5) improving the reliability and security of the network architecture by including identity management and
quantum key distribution (QKD), and all with a focus on improving various use cases related to mobility.
