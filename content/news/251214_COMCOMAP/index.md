The paper “LoRaWAN Performance under Vehicular Mobility: An Experimental Evaluation”, authored by UPCT (Universidad Politécnica de Cartagena) team members, was presented by Jose Santa at the International Conference on Communications, Computing and Applications (ComComAp 2025), held from 14 to 17 December 2025 in Madrid, Spain.

This research explores the behaviour of LoRaWAN under mobility conditions, assessing its performance in vehicular scenarios at different speeds and spreading factors. The findings provide valuable insights for optimising IoT connectivity in dynamic environments, paving the way for more resilient solutions in smart cities and mobile applications.
