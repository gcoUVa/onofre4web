From October 25 to 27, Murcia's Science Week transformed Paseo del Malecón into a hub of discovery, drawing crowds to 14,000 square meters of scientific exhibits. Among the highlights was the ONOFRE-3 project, showcasing its pioneering work in next-generation 5G and 6G networks. Focused on the complex integration of edge, fog, and cloud layers, ONOFRE-3 uses AI and machine learning to manage dynamic Quality of Service (QoS) needs, optimizing network performance for mobile applications.

At the event, ONOFRE-3’s team demonstrated how their technology secures data privacy across multi-cloud domains, critical for future smart city and transportation networks. Cooperative, Connected, and Automated Mobility (CCAM) and Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) use cases were also showcased, illustrating ONOFRE-3’s potential to meet the ultra-low latency and high-security demands of next-gen applications. The project underscores Murcia’s Science Week as a platform for innovation, showcasing technologies with potential economic and social impact.
