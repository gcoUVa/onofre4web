Our Ph.D. students, Emilio Ramos-Sorroche and Felipe García-Vidal from the Universidad Politécnica de Cartagena (UPCT), played an active role in the recent edition of the Jornadas de Ingeniería Telemática (JITEL 2025), that took place from 12 November to 14 November. Recognized as the premier forum in Spain for the telematics community, this event brings together academic and industrial experts to share the latest innovations in network engineering, services, and telecommunication applications.
During the conference, Ramos-Sorroche focused on the intersection of artificial intelligence and urban sustainability, presenting a comparative analysis of predictive models designed to monitor air quality and forecast pollutant levels in metropolitan environments. Complementing this, Garcia-Vidal addressed the challenges of next-generation mobility, sharing insights on how to optimize data transmission in vehicular networks by evaluating mechanisms that leverage multi-channel operations. Their participation underscores our team’s ongoing commitment to advancing research in critical fields such as Smart Cities and intelligent transportation systems.
