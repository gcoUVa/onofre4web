abstract: "Ph.D. Student Andres Ruz-Nieto participated in the MobiCom 2023 conference, held in Madrid from October 2-6. MobiCom, renowned as one of the paramount international conferences in the domain of mobile networks and computing. He has presented the advances of a simulation framework that uses 3D environment modeling and ray-tracing to obtain realistic results of LoRaWAN deployments. The event facilitated a platform for the exchange of innovative research findings and developments. During the demonstrative and poster session, Ruz-Nieto presented the work produced within his research group, thereby availing it to constructive feedback from fellow participants and industry peers."

On Friday 27th September, the UMU team participated in the event held in Murcia on the occasion of the European Researchers' Night. Advances and technologies used in ONOFRE-3 were presented to the general public, all of them framed in the research fields of AI and networks of the future. Thus, a real-time demonstration was given of an AI capable of inferring a person's emotions through their image captured by a state-of-the-art camera, capable of processing AI models. Thus, one of the key functionalities in the project was demonstrated: offloading of AI-based processing functions to the edge. In addition, a fully functional 5G network was deployed and demonstrated, this being the technology that underpins all the research developed in ONOFRE-3. In parallel to these demonstrations, educational games were also offered with questions and answers on basic concepts and applications covered in the project: IoT, vehicular networks, smart-cities, etc.
