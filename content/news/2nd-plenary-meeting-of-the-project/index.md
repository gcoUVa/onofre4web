On 12th January 2023 the second plenary meeting of the project was held at UPCT premises, counting with the participation of representatives from UVA, UMU and I2Cat. The agenda included a review of the main objectives and tasks of the project, the main advances towards reaching such objectives by the four institutions, and a set of technical sessions with particular research contributions. The event served to assess the overall progress of the project and consider future steps for the second half of the grant period. Interesting cooperation opportunities were identified, and expectations for the last part of the project are high, with software/hardware advances in essential research areas of network planning, orchestration, 6G enablers, new-age security and privacy contributions, experimental set-ups in the vehicular domain, and tests.
