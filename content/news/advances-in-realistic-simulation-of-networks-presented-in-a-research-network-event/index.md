The UPCT team has presented the advances in the simulation framework to be part of the ONOFRE-3 framework, including the integration of a network simulator, raytracing, GIS and 3D modeling and animation. Preliminary results indicate that simulations using this tool outperforms the results expected using common empirical models such as Log-Distance or Okumura-Hata. The tests have been carried out in urban settings, being this a worst-case scenario with buildings, terrain elevation and vegetation.
