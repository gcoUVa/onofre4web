abstract: Encouraged by the European Union, all European countries need to enforce
  solutions to reduce non-renewable energy consumption in buildings. The reduction
  of energy (heating, domestic hot water, and appliances consumption) aims for the
  vision of near-zero energy consumption as a requirement goal for constructing buildings.
  In this paper, we review the available standards, tools and frameworks on the energy
  performance of buildings. Additionally, this work investigates if energy performance
  ratings can be obtained with energy consumption data from IoT devices and if the
  floor size and energy consumption values are enough to determine a dwellings&rsquo;
  energy performance rating. The essential outcome of this work is a data-driven prediction
  tool for energy performance labels that can run automatically. The tool is based
  on the cutting edge kNN classification algorithm and trained on open datasets with
  actual building data such as those coming from the IoT paradigm. Additionally, it
  assesses the results of the prediction by analysing its accuracy values. Furthermore,
  an approach to semantic annotations for energy performance certification data with
  currently available ontologies is presented. Use cases for an extension of this
  work are also discussed in the end.
