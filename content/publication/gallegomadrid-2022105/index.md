abstract: The exponential growth of mobile applications and services during the last
  years has challenged the existing network infrastructures. Consequently, the arrival
  of multiple management solutions to cope with this explosion along the end-to-end
  network chain has increased the complexity in the coordinated orchestration of different
  segments composing the whole infrastructure. The Zero-touch Network and Service
  Management (ZSM) concept has recently emerged to automatically orchestrate and manage
  network resources while assuring the Quality of Experience (QoE) demanded by users.
  Machine Learning (ML) is one of the key enabling technologies that many ZSM frameworks
  are adopting to bring intelligent decision making to the network management system.
  This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art application of
  ML-based techniques to improve ZSM performance. To this end, the main related standardization
  activities and the aligned international projects and research efforts are deeply
  examined. From this dissection, the skyrocketing growth of the ZSM paradigm can
  be observed. Concretely, different standardization bodies have already designed
  reference architectures to set the foundations of novel automatic network management
  functions and resource orchestration. Aligned with these advances, diverse ML techniques
  are being currently exploited to build further ZSM developments in different aspects,
  including multi-tenancy management, traffic monitoring, and architecture coordination,
  among others. However, different challenges, such as the complexity, scalability,
  and security of ML mechanisms, are also identified, and future research guidelines
  are provided to accomplish a firm development of the ZSM ecosystem.
