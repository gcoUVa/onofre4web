 abstract = {Digitalization across the healthcare industry is improving the quality and personalization of the services provided to patients. Currently, we are observing great advances in aspects such as doctor-patient coordination, real-time health monitoring, communication between different specialist, or administrative tasks automation, among others. However, this hyperconnectivity also brings important challenges related to the cyber-security of the critical eHealth infrastructures. Privacy concerns, intrusion detection, secure data exchange, etc. are crucial factors that should be addressed when designing digital healthcare platforms. In this chapter, a wide overview of the cyber-security landscape in the eHealth sector is presented, emphasizing the biggest challenges to be faced during the next years. Then, as the main contribution of this work, it is proposed a holistic cyber-security platform that tackles privacy and security risks in an automated fashion to foster the development of innovative applications within the healthcare ecosystem.},
