abstract: Digitalization across the healthcare industry is improving the quality and
  personalization of the services provided to patients. Currently, we are observing
  great advances in aspects such as doctor-patient coordination, real-time health
  monitoring, communication between different specialist, or administrative tasks
  automation, among others. However, this hyperconnectivity also brings important
  challenges related to the cyber-security of the critical eHealth infrastructures.
  Privacy concerns, intrusion detection, secure data exchange, etc. are crucial factors
  that should be addressed when designing digital healthcare platforms. In this chapter,
  a wide overview of the cyber-security landscape in the eHealth sector is presented,
  emphasizing the biggest challenges to be faced during the next years. Then, as the
  main contribution of this work, it is proposed a holistic cyber-security platform
  that tackles privacy and security risks in an automated fashion to foster the development
  of innovative applications within the healthcare ecosystem.
