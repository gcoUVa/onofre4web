abstract: With the ongoing fifth-generation cellular network (5G) deployment, electromagnetic
  field exposure has become a critical concern. However, measurements are scarce,
  and accurate electromagnetic field reconstruction in a geographic region remains
  challenging. This work proposes a conditional generative adversarial network to
  address this issue. The main objective is to reconstruct the electromagnetic field
  exposure map accurately according to the environment&rsquo;s topology from a few
  sensors located in an outdoor urban environment. The model is trained to learn and
  estimate the propagation characteristics of the electromagnetic field according
  to the topology of a given environment. In addition, the conditional generative
  adversarial network-based electromagnetic field mapping is compared with simple
  kriging. Results show that the proposed method produces accurate estimates and is
  a promising solution for exposure map reconstruction.
