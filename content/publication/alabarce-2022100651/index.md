abstract: "Telecom operators' infrastructure is sustained by optical communication\
  \ networks that provide the means for exchanging large amounts of information, which\
  \ is essential for many modern society needs. Optical networks are characterized\
  \ by rapid breakthroughs in a variety of technologies. Relevantly, the last decade\
  \ encompassed remarkable advances in optical networks’ subfields of signal processing,\
  \ electronics, photonics, communications, protocols, and control-plane architectures.\
  \ Hence, these advancements unlocked unprecedented transmission capacities, reconfigurability\
  \ and programmability, entailing an evolution in the way which networks were designed,\
  \ planned, and analyzed. In this paper, we review the historical status of optical\
  \ planning and design tools by focusing on the major enabling technologies and relevant\
  \ landmarks of the last decade(s). We begin by pinpointing the major breakthroughs\
  \ in the optical data plane, estimation models capturing the transmission medium\
  \ behavior and the control plane. We then distil the implications that these advancements\
  \ entail in the landscape of optical network design and analysis tools, which commonly\
  \ sit “on top” of the control plane or as a fully separated entity. Then, we speculate\
  \ with our view for the future, in which automatic validation of optical network\
  \ operations and dimensioning jointly with learning/artificial intelligence mechanisms\
  \ will permit zero-touch optical networking: i.e. updating, provisioning, and upgrading\
  \ network capacities, by means of automation with minimal human intervention. We\
  \ conclude with a proposal of an architecture that encompasses data and control\
  \ planes in a comprehensive manner for paving the way towards zero-touch optical\
  \ networking."
