abstract: In this paper, we investigate a novel problem for dimensioning optical networks
  with digital subcarrier-based point-to-multipoint (P2MP) coherent transceivers,
  which we refer to as tree-determination, routing, and spectrum assignment (TRSA).
  Given a physical optical fiber network with P2MP transceivers and a target IP topology
  with associated capacity requirements, the TRSA problem involves partitioning capacity
  demands into logical hub--spoke trees and associated transceiver allocation, along
  with light-tree routing and spectrum assignment. We propose a heuristic algorithm
  to solve the TRSA problem with and without fault tolerance for arbitrary network
  topologies. The algorithms are used to evaluate potential cost benefits of P2MP
  transceivers for different IP densities and loads in a case study on a metro-network
  reference scenario. Results indicate that P2MP equipment can bring significant transceiver
  cost and equipment savings in comparison to point-to-point solutions, although such
  savings come at a trade-off with increased spectrum occupation.
