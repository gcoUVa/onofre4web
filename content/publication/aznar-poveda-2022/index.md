abstract: In vehicular communications, the increase of the channel load caused by
  excessive periodical messages (beacons) is an important aspect which must be controlled
  to ensure the appropriate operation of safety applications and driver-assistance
  systems. To date, the majority of congestion control solutions involve including
  additional information in the payload of the messages transmitted, which may jeopardize
  the appropriate operation of these control solutions when channel conditions are
  unfavorable, provoking packet losses. This study exploits the advantages of non-cooperative,
  distributed beaconing allocation, in which vehicles operate independently without
  requiring any costly road infrastructure. In particular, we formulate the beaconing
  rate control problem as a Markov Decision Process and solve it using approximate
  reinforcement learning to carry out optimal actions. Results obtained were compared
  with other traditional solutions, revealing that our approach, called SSFA, is able
  to keep a certain fraction of the channel capacity available, which guarantees the
  delivery of emergency-related notifications with faster convergence than other proposals.
  Moreover, good performance was obtained in terms of packet delivery and collision
  ratios.
