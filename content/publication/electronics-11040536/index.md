abstract: 'Climate change is increasing temperatures and causing periods of water
  scarcity in arid and semi-arid climates. The agricultural sector is one of the most
  affected by these changes, having to optimise scarce water resources. An important
  phenomenon within the water cycle is the evaporation from water reservoirs, which
  implies a considerable amount of water lost during warmer periods of the year. Indeed,
  evaporation rate forecasting can help farmers grow crops more sustainably by managing
  water resources more efficiently in the context of precision agriculture. In this
  work, we expose an interpretable machine learning approach, based on a multivariate
  decision tree, to forecast the evaporation rate on a daily basis using data from
  an Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure, which is deployed on a real irrigated
  plot located in Murcia (southeastern Spain). The climate data collected feed the
  models that provide a forecast of evaporation and a summary of the parameters involved
  in this process. Finally, the results of the interpretable presented model are validated
  with the best literature models for evaporation rate prediction, i.e., Artificial
  Neural Networks, obtaining results very similar to those obtained for them, reaching
  up to 0.85R2 and 0.6MAE. Therefore, in this work, a double objective is faced: to
  maintain the performance obtained by the models most frequently used in the problem
  while maintaining the interpretability of the knowledge captured in it, which allows
  better understanding the problem and carrying out appropriate actions.'
