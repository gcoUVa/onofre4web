abstract: The application of data-driven methods is expected to play an increasingly
  important role in healthcare. However, a lack of personnel with the necessary skills
  to develop these models and interpret its output is preventing a wider adoption
  of these methods. To address this gap, we introduce and describe ORIENTATE, a software
  for automated application of machine learning classification algorithms by clinical
  practitioners lacking specific technical skills. ORIENTATE allows the selection
  of features and the target variable, then automatically generates a number of classification
  models and cross-validates them, finding the best model and evaluating it. It also
  implements a custom feature selection algorithm for systematic searches of the best
  combination of predictors for a given target variable. Finally, it outputs a comprehensive
  report with graphs that facilitates the explanation of the classification model
  results, using global interpretation methods, and an interface for the prediction
  of new input samples. Feature relevance and interaction plots provided by ORIENTATE
  allow to use it for statistical inference, which can replace and/or complement classical
  statistical studies.
