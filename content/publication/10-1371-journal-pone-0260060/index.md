abstract: Accurate characterization and simulation of electromagnetic propagation
  can be obtained by ray-tracing methods, which are based on a high frequency approximation
  to the Maxwell equations and describe the propagating field as a set of propagating
  rays, reflecting, diffracting and scattering over environment elements. However,
  this approach has been usually too computationally costly to be used in large and
  dynamic scenarios, but this situation is changing thanks the increasing availability
  of efficient ray-tracing libraries for graphical processing units. In this paper
  we present Opal, an electromagnetic propagation simulation tool implemented with
  ray-tracing on graphical processing units, which is part of the Veneris framework.
  Opal can be used as a stand-alone ray-tracing simulator, but its main strength lies
  in its integration with the game engine, which allows to generate customized 3D
  environments quickly and intuitively. We describe its most relevant features and
  provide implementation details, highlighting the different simulation types it supports
  and its extension possibilites. We provide application examples and validate the
  simulation on demanding scenarios, such as tunnels, where we compare the results
  with theoretical solutions and further discuss the tradeoffs between the simulation
  types and its performance.
