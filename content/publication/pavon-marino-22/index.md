abstract: We present the first generalized dimensioning algorithm for optical networks
  with subcarrier-based Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) coherent transceivers, which covers
  hub-spoke determination, transceiver allocation, along with light-tree routing and
  spectrum assignment, in arbitrary topologies. The benefits of P2MP optics in a metro-network
  case study are evaluated.
