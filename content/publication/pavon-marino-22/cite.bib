 abstract = {We present the first generalized dimensioning algorithm for optical networks with subcarrier-based Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) coherent transceivers, which covers hub-spoke determination, transceiver allocation, along with light-tree routing and spectrum assignment, in arbitrary topologies. The benefits of P2MP optics in a metro-network case study are evaluated.},
