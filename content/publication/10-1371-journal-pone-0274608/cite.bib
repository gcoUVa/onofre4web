 abstract = {Diabetes mellitus is a disease associated with abnormally high levels of blood glucose due to a lack of insulin. Combining an insulin pump and continuous glucose monitor with a control algorithm to deliver insulin is an alternative to patient self-management of insulin doses to control blood glucose levels in diabetes mellitus patients. In this work, we propose a closed-loop control for blood glucose levels based on deep reinforcement learning. We describe the initial evaluation of several alternatives conducted on a realistic simulator of the glucoregulatory system and propose a particular implementation strategy based on reducing the frequency of the observations and rewards passed to the agent, and using a simple reward function. We train agents with that strategy for three groups of patient classes, evaluate and compare it with alternative control baselines. Our results show that our method is able to outperform baselines as well as similar recent proposals, by achieving longer periods of safe glycemic state and low risk.},
