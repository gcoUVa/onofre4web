abstract: Diabetes mellitus is a disease associated with abnormally high levels of
  blood glucose due to a lack of insulin. Combining an insulin pump and continuous
  glucose monitor with a control algorithm to deliver insulin is an alternative to
  patient self-management of insulin doses to control blood glucose levels in diabetes
  mellitus patients. In this work, we propose a closed-loop control for blood glucose
  levels based on deep reinforcement learning. We describe the initial evaluation
  of several alternatives conducted on a realistic simulator of the glucoregulatory
  system and propose a particular implementation strategy based on reducing the frequency
  of the observations and rewards passed to the agent, and using a simple reward function.
  We train agents with that strategy for three groups of patient classes, evaluate
  and compare it with alternative control baselines. Our results show that our method
  is able to outperform baselines as well as similar recent proposals, by achieving
  longer periods of safe glycemic state and low risk.
