abstract: The electric grid is undertaking a change of paradigm. New requirements
  such as the high power loads of Electric Vehicles’ charging are putting pressure
  on grids, and the popularisation of the figure of the prosumers, are creating new
  needs on the management of the system. Although the investment on infrastructure
  is one of the ways of alleviating the arrival of this new loads, the existence of
  smart controls, actuators and smart appliances opens also the door for demand modification.
  The so called Demand Response Events are strategies to reallocate the loads of the
  consumers, so the power demand is shifted towards times less critical for the grid.
  Some smart appliances can be considered as shiftable. The operation of them can
  be rescheduled to other times and still provide their services. On this paper we
  suggest an optimisation methodology consisting on a parallelisation method together
  with a generic algorithm that would allow an overlooking controller (such as aggregator
  or DSO) reduce the power peaks even with a large number of devices to control. The
  research here presented has looked for the smallest group size at which the optimisation
  is more effectible done in parallel groups rather than on a single large set. With
  this, we eliminated the exponential growth of the computational effort that the
  optimisation algorithm would need to do organising all devices in one go. The method
  achieves a computational time reduction of 80%, and it is only worsening the reduction
  of peak by 2.8% compared to an optimisation with a complete set.
